      <p>I want to become a web developer because of chance to never stop learning. I am currently a veterinary technician at a animal hospital, but i feel as if my will to learn has expanded outside the capabilities of my postition. When learning to become a web developer i know that growth never stops, and there is always room for improvement. I even feel more accomplished when i debug my own code and its a feeling that has been gone for a while. </p>
